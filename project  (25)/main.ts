//25. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
//variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
//a message that the player just earned 5 points.

//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
//fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

//define variable
let alienColor = "Black";

if (alienColor === "Black"){
       //code block
       console.log("Aline color is Black players just earnd 5 points.");
}
if(alienColor === "White"){
    console.log("Alien color is White");
}
