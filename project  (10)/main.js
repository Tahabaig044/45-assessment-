//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything 
//specific to write
//because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
//Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
// Define the value of pi
var pi = 3.14;
// Define the radius of the circle
var radius = 5;
// Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = pi * radius * radius
var area = pi * radius * radius;
// Log the area to the console
console.log("The area of the circle is: ".concat(area));
