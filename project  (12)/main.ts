//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



let friendName = ["talha","bilal","umair","zeeshan"];

friendName.forEach(nameFriend =>   console.log (`Hello ${nameFriend} how are you`));
